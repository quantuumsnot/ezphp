EzPHP gives you a personal PHP webserver for development. 

The goal of the project is to provide a single **.exe** file that will get you a ready to use PHP development environment.

EzPHP will install PHP v. 7.4.14 downloaded from https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-7.4.14-nts-Win32-vc15-x64.zip

### Installation

1. Download [ezphp.zip](https://github.com/marcomilon/ezphp).
2. Create a new folder for your project and copy ezphp.exe.
3. Run ezphp.exe. If PHP is not installed locally ezphp will try to download and install PHP.
4. Open your browser in http://localhost:8080. 

Advanced user execute `ezphp.exe -h` to view all options.

```
Usage of ./ezphp:
  -S string
        <addr>:<port> - Run with built-in web server. (default "localhost:8080")
  -t string
        <docroot> - Specify document root <docroot> for built-in web server. (default "public_html")
```

### How it works?

After launching ezphp.exe you will get a PHP web server on port 8080. See Usage to change the port. 

To start working just copy your PHP files to the **Document root** folder and then open the url **http://localhost:8080** on your web browser.
